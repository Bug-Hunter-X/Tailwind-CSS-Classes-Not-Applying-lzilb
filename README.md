# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly or not at all.  This can be due to several factors, including incorrect configuration, missing or conflicting styles, or problems during the build process.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code snippet. The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates various ways to fix this problem.

## Possible Causes:

* **Incorrect Configuration:** Ensure Tailwind is correctly configured in your project. Check your `tailwind.config.js` (or `tailwind.config.cjs`) file to confirm that your content paths are accurate and your theme is defined properly.
* **Missing or Conflicting Styles:** Check for any CSS that might be overriding your Tailwind classes.
* **Build Issues:**  Make sure your project builds correctly and that Tailwind's output CSS is correctly included in your project.
* **Purge/Content Configuration (If using JIT):** If using Tailwind's Just-In-Time mode, ensure your `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` correctly includes all the templates where you're using the classes.
